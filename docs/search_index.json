Aim 1.1: Test a 3-dimensional model of adversity based on recent theory (thread, deprivation, unpredictabiltiy), and, if this theorized model does not fit the data well, identify the best-fitting adversity dimensional model in this sample. Aim 1.2: Test how adversity dimensions are related to alexithymia. Aim 2: Characterize profiles/groups of young adults according to their experieces, psychosocial risk/protective factors, and health. 2.3 Background WILL ADD MORE HERE "],["study-details.html", "Section 3 Study Details 3.1 Study Design 3.2 Questionnaires 3.3 Study Contributions 3.4 Funding", " Section 3 Study Details 3.1 Study Design ECHOES is a fully online study that recruited entirely from Prolific. ECHOES was designed to get a relatively large sample size (target N = 400) with a brief protocol (~30 minutes). It is a cross-sectional study with 1 timepoint. Trhough Prolific, an equal number of male and female participants were recruited, and a ratio of White/non-White participants consistent with the United States population of young adults (212/400 or 53% White, 188/400 or 47% non-White). 3.2 Questionnaires Questionnaires are listed below in the order they were administered to participants: Demographics BAB Lab Visceral Sensitivity Index (vsi) Adapted by FQ and BC from: Labus JS, Bolus R, Chang L, Wiklund I, Naesdal J, Mayer EA, Naliboff BD.

Since fit to the data was not adequate (LIST CUTOFFS HERE), we performed EFA using promax rotation. We selected 3 factors for the EFA based on the Silouette and Parallel Plots methods. We then performed CFA on the model selected by EFA. After obtaining factor scores for each participant from the CFA, we then used an OLS regression model to test associations of each factor (controlling of other factors, age, and sex) with alexithymia. 5.2 Analysis Scripts Analysis scripts can be found at: [insert github repo link once public] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
